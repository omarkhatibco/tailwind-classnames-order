# tailwind-classnames-order
Order your tailwind classnames so they will look more sense to you.

## It's just an Idea 
One of the problem facing me in tailwind that eveything look random 

so what if we have a linter that read the classname and reorder it in a way that make more sense for us ?

for example `block md:flex border justify-start md:z-20 relative border-red z-10` to something better like 

`relative block md:flex justify-center border border-red z-10 md:z-20` ?
